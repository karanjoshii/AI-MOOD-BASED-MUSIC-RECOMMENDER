🔹 Music influences mental health—personalized playlists improve well-being.
🔹 No manual searching—AI instantly finds songs based on your mood.

✨ Key Features
✅ Real-time Emotion Detection (Facial, Speech, & Text Analysis)
✅ Seamless Integration (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music)
✅ Multi-Modal AI (Voice, Text, & Facial Analysis)
✅ Adaptive Learning (Improves recommendations over time)
✅ Personalized Mood Playlists
